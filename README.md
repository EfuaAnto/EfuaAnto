### Hi there 👋
I'm Antonella, and I'm  currently a student At the University Studying Computer Science.\n 
/nHere's a bit about what I'm up to on GitHub:
🔭so I’m not currently working on anything.
🌱 But I am currently Exploring possible career paths I can pursue, as a result, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge with Courses in Javascript, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS.
🤔 I’m not specifically looking for help with anything but any help is appreciated.
📫 How to reach me: (so sorry I will fill this soon👍).
⚡ Fun fact: I speak 4 languages well 5 but that's high school Spanish so it doesn't count😂.
